Collection of folders and projects dedicated to learning about Artifical Intelligence using python. Lessons revolve around utilizing the OpenCV, numpy, pandas, Request, and BeautifulSoup Modules.
- numpy = Module for Scientific computation. Making arrays, matrices, dot/cross products, and other calculus/LinearAlgebra based operations.
- pandas = Module to access 'Data Frames' as a way to store list data as a table. Uses a Map structure of <columnKeys, valueLists>.
- Request = Module to make HTTP requests to gather data from the web. Tables, structured data, text, etc.
